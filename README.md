# Hello!

Welcome to this extrapolation of my portion of work from a project I completed while taking CS0010 (Big Ideas in Computing & Info) during my first semester of college at the University of Pittsburgh in Fall 2021.

Dataset parsed:
- Pittsburgh Public Schools Enrollment by Neighborhood 2020-21 School Year

Abstract:
- One of the most important metrics that I believe needs to be addressed when a new or aspiring family is looking to place roots is that of where their children will be attending school. Young children spend so much of their critical developing years in school, so it is crucial that parents take the time to consider just where exactly they will send them to practice socialization among their peers. I feel that neighborhoods rich with a population of young children enrolled in public schools create the perfect local and accessible community for socialization. Furthermore, schools with greater racial/ethnic diversity prevent children from learning to "other" those that may look differently than them or who come from different backgrounds. I determined that Carrick is the neighborhood in Pittsburgh with the greatest abundance of K-12 students enrolled in its public schools by sorting through 2020-21 school year data and comparing its total enrollment count with that of surrounding neighborhoods. Then, I imposed the Simpson's Diversity Index calculation upon the same dataset to find that Beechview had the most wholly diverse public school environment in Pittsburgh. These findings led me to believe that Carrick and Beechview would be very enriching communities for those looking to raise children in Pittsburgh.

Aside: 
- I will use the terms race and ethnicity interchangably throughout this project as a consequence of this dataset including both ethnicity and race simultaneously in its labeling. I would like to acknowledge the importance of recognizing the difference between these terms and I sincerely apologize for the blurred distinction.
